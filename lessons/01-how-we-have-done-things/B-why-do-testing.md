## Why even test?

DMA Knowledge bytes: BDD real world examples and Best practices
This session will showcase real-world examples of successful implementations of Behavior Driven Development (BDD) and lesson learned

- Testing frequently must not slow you down (treat as production code)
- Tests should feel like a help
