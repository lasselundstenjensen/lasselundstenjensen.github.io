#### **Importance of tests during refactoring**

When refactoring, tests are a safety net that allows us to make changes with confidence. You want to press that button often!

#### **What the tests did**

They focused on testing the **behavior** of the evaluation service and the evaluator library.

#### **Because of this..**

- Building a new custom library with similar interfaces for input and output was easier
- Tests could continuously ensure that behaviour was the same
