#### **The problem**

The library worked great in the beginning when things were simple. A service was built around it for AI model evaluation and reports could be generated.

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

But when the model complexity grew, the library lacked features that made it impossible to fulfill user requirements.

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

So we had to do surgery.. :)

#### **Importance of tests during refactoring**

When refactoring, tests are a safety net that allows us to make changes with confidence. You want to press that button often!

#### **We had something like this**

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

#### **What the tests did**

They focused on testing the **behavior** of the evaluation service and the evaluator library.

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

#### **Because of this..**

- Building a new custom library with similar interfaces for input and output was faster
- Tests could continuously ensure that behaviour was the same
